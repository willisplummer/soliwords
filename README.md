# Crossword Solitaire Solver

A program that will find a valid crossword solitaire solution given a set of letters.
NOTE: eventually, I'd like to find all valid solutions

### Rules
Use ALL 12 letters to make words that connect
Words must have at least 3 letters
No proper nouns and/or names (we'll be using the 2023 NASPA Word List)
