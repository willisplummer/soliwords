# Crossword Solitaire Solver

A program that will find all valid crossword solitaire solutions given a set of letters.

### Rules
Use ALL 12 letters to make words that connect
Words must have at least 3 letters
No proper nouns and/or names (we'll be using the 2023 NASPA Word List)

### TODO:
- [x] I think sometimes answers are going off the grid (fix might just be to use a larger grid)
- [ ] I'm getting stack overflows when I let it solve with 3 letter words
- [ ] Would be cool to eliminate duplicate solutions (e.g. same answer but just rotated)
-   [ ] Need to improve the logic for using multiple placed letters in a single answer
